1. If it’s your job to eat a frog, it’s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it’s your job to eat two frogs, it’s best to eat the biggest one first - **Mark Twain**

2. When something good happens, travel to celebrate. When something bad happens, travel to forget it. If nothing happens, travel to make something happen - **Prince Ea**
